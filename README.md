# RECURSION

1. What is recursion ?
Function calling itself.

2. Why we need recursion ? (Use of recursion)
* It helps us in solving bigger/complex problems in a simple/easy way.
* You can convert the recursion solutions into iterations(not using any function calls, only loops) and vice-versa
  Tip : First solve complex problems using recursion then convert it into iteration to get a more optimised answer. Because
  directly solving using iterations is difficult that's why we use recursion.
* Space complexity isn't constant because of recursive calls.
* It helps us in breaking down bigger problems into smaller problems.
